We do the Hierarichal Clustering Implementation on the IRIS datset.
## First we Standarized the Data
## Apply the PCA Technique to reduced the Dimension of the dataset covert to the 2-dimnsion.
##  Apply Agglomaterative CLustering
## Through the Dendrogram ethod we choose number of clustering.
## silhouette_score through we find the best score.
## Through silhouette_score  The Number of clusters of 2 give the best score.
